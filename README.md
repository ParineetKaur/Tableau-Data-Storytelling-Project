# Tableau: Data Storytelling Project

## About This Repository 
This project was part of my OMIS 112 course and was done in collaboration with 3 other team members. We explored Airbnb listings in New York City using publicly available data from InsideAirbnb. Alongside, we analyzed how pricing accuracy, host behavior, and listing distribution vary across neighborhoods, room types, and over time. The key goals of this project included identifying overpriced and underpriced areas, tracking host participation trends, and understanding the market impact of policy changes like NYC’s Local Law 18.

We used a variety of calculated fields — including pricing deviations from neighborhood averages and prediction errors based on review scores — to evaluate how fair and consistent Airbnb pricing is. Overall, the findings show that overpricing is not just common but also concentrated in a few neighborhoods, while underpricing is more spread out. We also built forecasts to predict host activity through 2027, which suggested continued decline with high uncertainty due to recent policy shifts and post-COVID recovery patterns.
